Design
------
1. Program is written using C++11.

2. Used boost library on top of the standard library to parse the JSON file.

3. Class Sensor designed to hold the sensor id and temperature reading in a vector. 

4. Timestamp information is not stored in the sensor object, Class TemperatureReading is designed to hold timestamp and temperature information for future evolution.

5. Exception class TDPException added in case to notify the user with appropriate error.

6. Map<sensorId, Sensor> created to store the sensor related information to keep in mind that accessing any sensor related data with logarithmic complextiy.

7. Average calculation is contant time operation as the sum is calculated while adding the temperature to the Sensor object.

8. Vector holding the termperature reading is sorted prior to median and mode calculation.

9. For mode calculation, I am using the slicing window approach where I will be moving the 2 iterators based on the presence of same element.
